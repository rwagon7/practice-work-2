## Javascript Concepts

# DAY1
- clousers: function inside of function, act like factory classes which return a function
- hoisiting: function in js are hoisted, except the nammed functionsd 

# DAY2
- ClassCounter: We define a ts class named ClassCounter.ts which has a variable n and function increment, and we call the increment method on the instance of class to increase the value of the class variable
- Counter: We create a function that returns a function, with a variable inside the outer function, so whenever we call the outer function the varibale will be incremented with the help of return statement.(can use the trem closure)

# DAY3
- ClassCounter 2: Create a class with a number variable "n" and 3 methods. we now create a instance and call methods from the instance according using dot operator
